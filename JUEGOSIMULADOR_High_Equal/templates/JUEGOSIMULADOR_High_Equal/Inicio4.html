    OBJECTIVE
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <p>
        The objective of the decision in production is to minimize the total cost.
        The costs can come from inventory holding, production and backorder in each period.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are no setup costs and the time to produce a Kg is 0 (no Lead time).
    </p>
    <h4>
        1. Inventory Holding Costs
    </h4>
    <p>
        This cost is the one paid in order to storage the products that were not sold in each period.
        In each period you will be reminded of the holding cost.
    </p>

    <h3>
        2. Production Costs
    </h3>
    <p>
        For each kilogram of product produced, there is a cost attached, this cost will be shown in each decision page.
    </p>

    <h3>
        3. Backorder Cost
    </h3>

    <p>
        This cost refers to the cost of not being able to supply the demand.
        And so the ammount of demand not supplied is stacked as negative inventory and has a cost for each period not supplied.
