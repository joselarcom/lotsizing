    <p>
        You, as a planner, are responsible of the master product programming of the polyestiren (RED and BLUE).
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that you will  decide on how much to produce for 2 products.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your performance is vital for the economic success of the enterprise.
</p>

    <h4>
        DECISION
    </h4>

    <p>
        Your task is to decide the ammount of thread (kg), of each color, to be produced in each period.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Sequence of Events
    </h4>

    <p>
        (1) The initial Inventories are observred for a period.
    </p>

    <p>
        (2) You then DECIDE on the <span style="font-weight:bold">production lotsize</span> of the period.



    </p>

    <p>
        (3) Demand of the period is revealed
    </p>

    <p>
        (4) Demand will be covered by the current stock plus the production lotsize just produced.
    </p>
<p>
        (5) If all the stock plus the production lotsize is not enough to cover the current demand, then the  <span style="font-weight:bold">uncovered demand</span>  is considered to be  <span style="font-weight:bold">back-ordered</span>,
    meaning that you still <span style="font-weight:bold">need to fulfill the demand at a later stage.</span>
    </p>
